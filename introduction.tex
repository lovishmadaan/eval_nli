\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is Natural Language Inference? How does it relate to commonsense reasoning?
  \item List some popular benchmarks like MNLI, SNLI, ANLI, AbductiveNLI ($\alpha$NLI), and ChaosNLI.
  \item Quite popular in the BERT era as one of the most reliable benchmarks but dropped out of fashion once \citet{brown2020languagemodelsfewshotlearners} claimed that large language models are very bad at NLI and have almost chance performance.
  \item We investigate and analyse if that's still the case with LLMs.
\end{itemize}
